                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is Rachid Nasr, I am an VFX Artist working mainly with Houdini and nuke software,I am comfortable doing both compositing and fx work,I graduated from the <a href="http://www.online-vfx.ru/" target="_blank">OVFX school</a> .</p>
                <h2>Skills</h2>
				<p>I am trained to do almost the whole shot in Houdini whether it's classical modeling or procedural,shading in VEX builder ,rigging and animation ,dynamics and fluid simulation and off course rendering in mantra.I can also write my own tools in Houdini with help of VEX,python or C/C++,although sinds houdini 12 appeared the possibility to run VEX code on points and vertex there is no need more to write C++ code you can do whatever you want with VEX. After the final rendering,I can assemble the shot in nuke software,with different passes ,The foundry nuke software is famous for the fact that you have total control on every pixel on your shot. </p>
